<h2>What does Biome Fest do?</h2>
<b>Biome Fest is meant to be a GUI version of minecraft-pi-server. This program communicates with the terminal and displays it in an easy to understand interface.</p>
<p>Biome fest is meant to be an easy to understand server software for MCPI users who want something that works right out of the box.</p>
<h2>Where is Biome Fest?</h2>
<p>Biome Fest 1.0 is coming out soon! All features have been implemented except for a chat feature. Also, this is still an early version, and does not use Mycellium. I wish to incoperate Mycellium for a less functional but way quicker server. (It's a framework, but it may work. I will have to play around more with the files.)</p>
<h2>What is the development track?</h2>
<p>This is what I would like to add</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chat and messaging of other players</li>
  <li>Wildly optimistic and insane idea, with hardly a glimmer of hope, of adding saved inventory</li>
  <li>A small tutorial world when first booting up Biome Fest</li>
  </ul>
