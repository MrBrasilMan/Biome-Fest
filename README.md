<h2>What does Biome Fest do?</h2>
<b>Biome Fest is meant to be a GUI version of minecraft-pi-server. This program communicates with the terminal and displays it in an easy to understand interface.</p>
<p>Biome fest is meant to be an easy to understand server software for MCPI users who want something that works right out of the box.</p>
<h2>Where is Biome Fest?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Biome Fest version 1.0 is still in development. However, I may dump a demo version that is not fully complete.</p>
<h2>What is the development track?</h2>
<p>This is what I would like to complete</p>
<ul>
  <li> Add basic server functionality, including saving preferences of server in the menu, and banning or messaging players on the server</li>
  <li> Allow for perphas a more robust messaging system, allowing for players to be more notified about server properties</li>
  <li> Long term and slightly wild goal: add inventory saving by the use of editing level.dat and replacing the player's inventory with a saved level.dat on the server as an expiremental feature (not recommended for large servers unless compressed</li>
  </ul>
